Project Ontwikkeling - Game

A schoolproject where we learned to make a game for a client, in this case for the province Antwerp.
<br>
The goal of this project is to make a game that encourages students,who do not live in Antwerp, to come study in Antwerp and become familiar with the city.<br>
Therefore we came up with the idea of making the protagonist an alien, so that the student and the alien can explore the city together.
<br>
#### Story 
<p>The alien is separated from his spaceship and has to get back to his home planet.<br>
There are police everywhere looking for him, so he has to go through these special places in Antwerp without being noticed.<br>
There is also a shop where the alien can buy disguise so that he will be less recognisable.</p>
